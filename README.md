Basically it is a game, where in a cooperative way, the two players have to help each other minimally to get all the gas cans and escape from the ship before the time runs out.

Some of the improvements that have been considered for the future, adding complex puzzles and powers of the style:
Player1, can step on lava but cannot activate certain plates.
Player2 can teleport and move objects.
